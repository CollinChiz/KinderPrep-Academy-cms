    alt: "My name is Ashley Handy, CEO/Owner of KinderPrep Academy I From a young
      age, I knew I was destined to become a teacher; I mean, what other
      10-year-old dresses in tights, turtlenecks, velvet skirts and clogs and
      requests an overhead projector for Christmas?!? The teachers who impacted
      my life the most were my music teachers and I wanted to make a difference
      in the world as well. I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with
      a degree in Elementary Education with concentrations in Language Arts &
      Humanities and Music.  Following graduation, I had the opportunity to work
      as a Lead Preschool teacher for The Goddard School, learning how to engage
      children aged 3-5 years old.  In order to get my foot in the door in
      public education, I accepted a position as an instructional assistant in a
      Kindergarten classroom where I was in charge of intervention groups for
      those children who were struggling to meet their educational benchmarks by
      creating engaging activities to help them reach their goals in literacy
      and mathematics. The summer after my husband and I welcomed our son in
      2013, I had the opportunity to work in a skilled nursing facility as a
      Customer Care Representative and I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the
      geriatric population! I knew that working with our elders was where I
      needed to be at that time.  Over the next seven years in healthcare, I
      would continue my education earning certifications as a Social Service
      Designee, Certified Nurse Assistant and Certified Dementia Practitioner.
      My heart was most drawn to caring for those living with
      Alzheimer’s/dementia as my grandmother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
      around the same time that I entered the healthcare world. I had the
      opportunity to use my education background to educate families, emergency
      responders and advocates on the disease process and how they could best
      help those living with Alzheimer’s/dementia. This February, I traveled
      1,500 miles across the country in order to celebrate my grandmother’s 90th
      birthday as I knew it could very well be her last with the physical and
      cognitive declines that she was experiencing. I walked into her house and
      immediately entered a twilight zone. She had all of the same furniture,
      all of the same family pictures hanging on the walls, all of the same toys
      her children used to play with… everything was the same. Her home brought
      back so many childhood memories for me and was excited to travel down
      Memory Lane with my grandmother! Now, working with those living with
      Alzheimer’s/dementia daily made me a bit numb to those moments when my
      residents would forget who I was. I prided myself in being able to jump in
      and out of their world as a quick friend and brush off any negative
      encounters, if needed. I was not, however, prepared for the moment when my
      own grandmother could not remember me… could not remember who my dad was
      or how I was related to her. She knew I was a “safe person” but the
      heaviest feeling came over my heart as we spent the first days of my visit
      trying to make the connection between her and me sink in. I am so grateful
      that I made the decision to take my two children with me on that trip. My
      son, Eli, (7) and daughter, Marley, (now 4) were going to be the key to us
      having those meaningful moments that made me realize the importance of the
      two generations interacting with one another. We arrived in Utah on
      February 26th, 2020. On the morning of February 27th, I witnessed the
      cutest interaction between my grandmother and my daughter, Marley. Marley
      wanted to play horses and my grandmother was tickled to do so. So tickled
      in fact, that the interaction triggered some deeply buried childhood
      memories of her horses when she was little. You can watch the video of
      this sweet interaction here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLlF_0S_DTM."

    alt: "This simple interaction sparked so many other childhood memories that she
      was eager to share with us throughout the day. I was ecstatic to be able
      to listen to the most memorable moments of her life even though the
      memories of the two of us did not exist in her world anymore.  By the
      third day of our stay, my son, Eli, would encourage her to participate in
      more cognitively challenging games like “Spot It” which was helping
      improve her brain synapses right before my eyes. She seemed to be more
      aware of her surrounding and of us as her family, though she still could
      not recall our exact relation or our names. "

    alt: "By day 5, the morning following her 90th birthday party where she had the
      chance to reminisce with one of her only remaining cousins, she came
      walking downstairs full of energy! She was able to recall my name, my
      relation to her and was more independent in her mental and physical
      function. I was absolutely flabbergasted! She was back to the grandmother
      that I remembered as a child who would vocalize how independent she was
      and that I did not need to do a single thing for her! 😊 We traveled home
      a couple of days later just in time to avoid the travel ban and I was back
      to working in the chaotic world of healthcare. Fast forward to April 14th,
      2020 where, due to COVID-19, my position as Admissions/Marketing Director
      was eliminated. I knew in my heart it was God pushing me to start pursuing
      my life’s calling… I knew I needed to actively start working towards
      bridging the gap between the two generations so that I could continue to
      make a difference in this world. The intergenerational program between
      KinderPrep Academy of Martinsville and A Senior Retreat will not only
      improve the lives of our elders but we will be creating a whole new
      generation of humans who will be in-tune with their elder counterparts-
      particularly those living with Alzheimer’s/dementia; a generation of
      people who won’t let those who fought for and built this country fall
      through the cracks. "
