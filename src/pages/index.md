      text: "My name is Ashley Handy, CEO/Owner of KinderPrep Academy I From a young
        age, I knew I was destined to become a teacher; I mean, what other
        10-year-old dresses in tights, turtlenecks, velvet skirts and clogs and
        requests an overhead projector for Christmas?!? The teachers who
        impacted my life the most were my music teachers and I wanted to make a
        difference in the world as well. I graduated from Indiana University
        Bloomington with a degree in Elementary Education with concentrations in
        Language Arts & Humanities and Music.  Following graduation, I had the
        opportunity to work as a Lead Preschool teacher for The Goddard School,
        learning how to engage children aged 3-5 years old.  In order to get my
        foot in the door in public education, I accepted a position as an
        instructional assistant in a Kindergarten classroom where I was in
        charge of intervention groups for those children who were struggling to
        meet their educational benchmarks by creating engaging activities to
        help them reach their goals in literacy and mathematics. The summer
        after my husband and I welcomed our son in 2013, I had the opportunity
        to work in a skilled nursing facility as a Customer Care Representative
        and I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the geriatric population! I knew that
        working with our elders was where I needed to be at that time.  Over the
        next seven years in healthcare, I would continue my education earning
        certifications as a Social Service Designee, Certified Nurse Assistant
        and Certified Dementia Practitioner. My heart was most drawn to caring
        for those living with Alzheimer’s/dementia as my grandmother had been
        diagnosed with Alzheimer’s around the same time that I entered the
        healthcare world. I had the opportunity to use my education background
        to educate families, emergency responders and advocates on the disease
        process and how they could best help those living with
        Alzheimer’s/dementia. This February, I traveled 1,500 miles across the
        country in order to celebrate my grandmother’s 90th birthday as I knew
        it could very well be her last with the physical and cognitive declines
        that she was experiencing. I walked into her house and immediately
        entered a twilight zone. She had all of the same furniture, all of the
        same family pictures hanging on the walls, all of the same toys her
        children used to play with… everything was the same. Her home brought
        back so many childhood memories for me and was excited to travel down
        Memory Lane with my grandmother! Now, working with those living with
        Alzheimer’s/dementia daily made me a bit numb to those moments when my
        residents would forget who I was. I prided myself in being able to jump
        in and out of their world as a quick friend and brush off any negative
        encounters, if needed. I was not, however, prepared for the moment when
        my own grandmother could not remember me… could not remember who my dad
        was or how I was related to her. She knew I was a “safe person” but the
        heaviest feeling came over my heart as we spent the first days of my
        visit trying to make the connection between her and me sink in. I am so
        grateful that I made the decision to take my two children with me on
        that trip. My son, Eli, (7) and daughter, Marley, (now 4) were going to
        be the key to us having those meaningful moments that made me realize
        the importance of the two generations interacting with one another. We
        arrived in Utah on February 26th, 2020. On the morning of February 27th,
        I witnessed the cutest interaction between my grandmother and my
        daughter, Marley. Marley wanted to play horses and my grandmother was
        tickled to do so. So tickled in fact, that the interaction triggered
        some deeply buried childhood memories of her horses when she was little.
        You can watch the video of this sweet interaction here:

      text: "This simple interaction sparked so many other childhood memories that she
        was eager to share with us throughout the day. I was ecstatic to be able
        to listen to the most memorable moments of her life even though the
        memories of the two of us did not exist in her world anymore.  By the
        third day of our stay, my son, Eli, would encourage her to participate
        in more cognitively challenging games like “Spot It” which was helping
        improve her brain synapses right before my eyes. She seemed to be more
        aware of her surrounding and of us as her family, though she still could
        not recall our exact relation or our names. "

      text: "By day 5, the morning following her 90th birthday party where she had the
        chance to reminisce with one of her only remaining cousins, she came
        walking downstairs full of energy! She was able to recall my name, my
        relation to her and was more independent in her mental and physical
        function. I was absolutely flabbergasted! She was back to the
        grandmother that I remembered as a child who would vocalize how
        independent she was and that I did not need to do a single thing for
        her! 😊 We traveled home a couple of days later just in time to avoid
        the travel ban and I was back to working in the chaotic world of
        healthcare. Fast forward to April 14th, 2020 where, due to COVID-19, my
        position as Admissions/Marketing Director was eliminated. I knew in my
        heart it was God pushing me to start pursuing my life’s calling… I knew
        I needed to actively start working towards bridging the gap between the
        two generations so that I could continue to make a difference in this
        world. The intergenerational program between KinderPrep Academy of
        Martinsville and A Senior Retreat will not only improve the lives of our
        elders but we will be creating a whole new generation of humans who will
        be in-tune with their elder counterparts- particularly those living with
        Alzheimer’s/dementia; a generation of people who won’t let those who
        fought for and built this country fall through the cracks. "
