KinderPrep Academy of Martinsville is the only intergenerational program in Morgan County, bridging the gap between the youth and the elders in the community. Our mission is to ensure that we develop a new generation of people who have the elders and their needs at the forefront of their minds, especially those living with Alzheimer's/dementia. 

We also believe that an early education is the foundation for social and academic success. Exposure to peer interactions and a structured environment in the first five years of life greatly affects their ability to move straight into the curriculum presented within both public and private education systems. Unfortunately, the cost of an early education is growing at an exponential rate. We strive to help as many preschool aged children have the opportunity to interact with their peers and their elder counterparts. That is why we have partnered with the Community Foundation of Morgan County to establish our KinderPrep Academy of Martinsville Scholarship Fund. For more information on current scholarship opportunities, email AshleyHandy@KPAofMartinsville.com. 

If you would like to support our mission, you can donate to our scholarship fund [here](https://cfmconline.org/donors/funds-2/kinderprep-academy-of-martinsville-scholarship-fund/).  Your donation will go directly towards covering tuition and meals for a child in need. We aspire to create a world where every child has a running start and every senior gets to enjoy the wonders of life through the eyes of a child again. The two generations need each other. With your support, we can make magical things happen!
